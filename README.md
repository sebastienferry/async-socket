# async-socket

## Brief

This .NET project has been created as a sandbox with the objective to understand how Windows IO Completion ports and SocketAsyncEventArgs works and how to use them.

It has been initiated while studying the source code of the NetMQ middleware.

AsyncSocket.Core is a simple library that exposes wrapper around .NET Socket and SocketAsyncEventArgs. The others projects are used for testing purpose.
